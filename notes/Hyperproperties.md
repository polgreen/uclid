Kinds of hyperproperties we want to prove

Prove step by step variable-by-variable
* Non-interference
* Injectivity 

Need other methods
* Commutativity (Symmetry?)
  - it could help to know that variables are equal?
  - cross-wise equivalence (a1 corresponds to b2 etc.)
* Associativity
* Idempotence  (don't need hyperproperties if we have a strong post condition?)
